    <h2>Viv</h2>

    <p>Hi there! I would like to introduce myself to you all. My name is Vivienne Amoh and I am from Johannesburg,South Africa.
        I come from a family of 6 individuals which inlcudes my mom,dad with 3 girls and 1 boy. How blessed we are to have such each other.
        I love my family so much and I truly appreciate all that they do to support me in my life.</p>
     <p>A little bit about me is that I love to read and write whnever I get the chnace to do so. I love drawing and recently I have learnt
        how to paint. Its really fun. I love music as it helps me focus on the many notes that take place.I love dogs and its my dream to own 
    a husky.I have been a member of the church for all my life. I love the gospel and I decided to serve a mission. I served in the 
     Ghana Cape Coast mission and it has been a year since I got back. I love being in service to others as it brings joy.</p>
     <p>I am currently studying Software Dvelopment and so far its been a good week. I am looking forward to learning more about the 
        software industry and to finally make a diffrence within the world.It will take much dedication to do so but I know that I can
        achieve this with all the hard work that I put in and always look forward in my studies.</p>
